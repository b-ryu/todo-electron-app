ðŸš§ **Note:** I recently bumped the versions of a bunch of dependencies that included several major updates. I haven't had time to go through and verify any issues that may have arose, but if you want you can pull down [this branch and run/build the pre-bump code.](https://github.com/b-ryu/todo-electron-app/tree/pre-bump)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
